Create user: highscores2_admin
Pass: [you set this, ideally 32 or more characters - Aa1!]


Create Highscores2 database...
I provided a sample_db for data/structure testing (You will have to rename it to highscores2).



Attach user highscores2_admin to Highscores2 database:
Access: highscores2_admin - With ADMIN - All privilege's.


Attach user highscores2_admin to CoLD_RP database.
Access: highscores2_admin - With READ.
This profile does NOT need all tables.
Read - bluerp_deathmatching
Read - bluerp_dmstats
Read - bluerp_player


4. Import the current cs_elo_seasons data to highscores2_seasons

5. Run table_setup.php
- This file will create the tables needed for highscores.

6. Add database_updater.php to a cronjob with a cycle of every 5 minutes or w/e time you want.

7. Add Highscores2_admin information to connect.php in web/.
